==============================================================
Welcome to v42-rel1!
We do a multi-step iteration with code generation, code judgment, and optional user feedback.
Keeping only the last 3 code attempts in context, plus user feedback.

==============================================================

<<User project description:>>

    You, an LLM, are being called by a python script on my, the user's, computer.
    You are running locally thus I am not paying per token, and I can run you indefinitely for only electricity cost.
    The API to access you is located at http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions
    Please try to write a python script that demonstrates connecting to the API and getting a test response in a chat message format.
    The output format should resemble an IRC log, as [timestamp] <user>:
    


==== Code Generation Step => Feedback 0, Code Iteration 1 ====
---- GPT Response (Code Generation) ----

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime

# Define the API endpoint
api_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions"

# Define the payload for the request
payload = {
    "model": "your-model-name",  # Replace with your model name if needed
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
}

# Make the POST request to the API
response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()

    # Extract the assistant's message
    assistant_message = data['choices'][0]['message']['content']

    # Get the current timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    # Print the IRC log format
    print(f"[{timestamp}] <user>: Hello, how are you?")
    print(f"[{timestamp}] <assistant>: {assistant_message}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to get response from API. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

[2025-03-25 21:02:10] <user>: Hello, how are you?
[2025-03-25 21:02:10] <assistant>: Hi there! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you? How's your day going so far?

==== Code Judgment Step => feedback 0, code iteration 1 ====
---- GPT Response (Code Judgment) ----

Project output fully satisfies project description, that is the final version and we can stop iterating
~~~~ GPT indicates the project is complete. Moving to user review. ~~~~

User, please review and provide feedback or press Enter to skip.
<<User feedback:>> 
No user feedback => project finalized. Goodbye!
